    <div id="intro" class="heading">Intro</div>
    <div>As Qard company started forming behind the scenes, we contemplated opening our virtual doors with very little known about NFC technology being used as a form of networking by the NFT Community. There were some companies who were breaking into the technology of NFC Chips, but absolutely none exploring the avenue of connecting the world of NFT’s to the world of NFC chips.
        <br><br><div><i>Note: Information about NFC chips can be found in the “Technology” Section.</i></div>
    <br><br><div>We also noticed there were different non-NFT driven companies harnessing the power of NFC chips working to charge you vast amounts of money for each product, for the monthly service, and sometimes both! </div>
    <br><br><div>That's where Qard comes in. Our mission is to provide frequent NFT value, visual data, social interoperability, and sustainable NFC products to the community. By purchasing a one time pass you will have access to a lifetime membership, reasonably priced replacement wearables, future customization, and a strategically fast shipping. </div>
    <br><br><div>With Qard you will have all your favorite analytics tools, social groups, NFT alerts, Exchanges, IRL conference Access, and cutting edge networking capabilities. </div>
    <br><br><div>You may be a little confused on how everything works but rest assured, you are in the right place. In the next few sections we will take you through the details and goals of Qard. We are excited share what we’ve been working on!</div>
</div>
<div id="technology" class="heading">Technology</div>
<div>A Near-Field Communication chip (NFC chip or NFC chipset) is a silicon component or Integrated Circuit (IC) that can be used in different ways, depending on the targeted application.</div>
<br><br><div>When connected to an appropriate antenna, an NFC chip enables short-range, wireless communication between two devices. This provides an additional layer of security, as only devices within close proximity of each other can communicate via NFC.</div>


<div id="application" class="heading">Application</div>
<div>The NFC technology was first introduced into smartphones in September 2011 and is now widely integrated into most phones, whether they are iOS or Android based.</div>
<br><br><div>An NFC-enabled smartphone uses an NFC controller chip connected to an NFC Antenna.</div>
<br><br><div>In other words, we program these chips for you to be scannable with your phone app. The end user will not need an app to view any dynamic information you wish to network. </div>

<div id="membership" class="heading">Membership</div>

<div>The following are membership package details, you will need a Qard Pass to qualify for these benefits. Furthermore the type of benefits will depend on if you hold a General Pass or an Ultimate Pass. </div>
<br><br><div><h3>Price</h3></div>
<div>Minting and holding a pass will give you lifetime access to our DAPP and products. Unlike non-NFT companies using NFC technology, we will not be charging a monthly fee.</div>
<br><br><div><h3>Supply</h3></div>
<div>Our passes will never exceed the following supply numbers:<ul><li>General Pass: 9,500</li><li>Ultimate Pass: 500</li></ul></div>
<br><br><div><h3>Claimable</h3></div>
<div>We will be sending out initial Qard products to our pass holders. Each pass recieves a starter pack as follows:<ul><li>General Pass: the “Starter Pack” comes with 1 claimable NFC powered item.</li><li>Ultimate Pass: The “Power Pack” comes with 3 claimable NFC powered Items.</li></ul></div>
<br><div><i>Note: Additional Items will be available for purchase.</i></div>
<br><br><div><h3>Dapp Access</h3></div>
<div>The DAPP will not be needed for the end user to receive your information. Let’s say you are at an event and meet a person you’d like to collaborate with at a later date. Simply take out any of your devices and let the person scan with their phone.</div> 
<br><div>There will be no need for this person to download our Dapp. The owner of the devices will have to set up the information they would like the person who scanned to see. This is where Qard is creating a unique experience, with varying capabilities based on which Qard Pass you own.</div>
<br><div>Premium access will thrive on the community feedback to build out the best features for an amazing experience.<ul><li>General Pass: Standard capabilities will be accessible for the enjoyment of the user. </li><li>Ultimate Pass: Premium capabilities will be accessible for the enjoyment of the user.</li></ul></div>
<br><br><div><h3>Dashboards</h3></div>
<div>Inside the dapp you will have the unique ability to create custom dashboards. Each dashboard will be categorized to your liking creating an all-in-one spot for all of your favorite NFT goodies.</div>
<br><div>All will have the ability to create a number of dashboards dependent upon their pass. Below the dashboards are broken down:<br><ul><li>General Pass: Can create up to 5 unique and editable dashboards.</li><li>Ultimate Pass: Can create an unlimited amount of unique and editable dashboards.</li></ul></div>
<br><br><div><h3>Devices</h3></div>
<div>Each item you purchase from Qard can be programmed to point to a specific bit of information or a broad bit built dynamically by creating sets. Each item will be able to be selected and assigned specific set you wish the item to be scannable for.</div>
<br><div>Each Qard item can serve a different purpose or be used fully for one specific use case. Qard will allow a specific number of items to be designated at once depending on the minted pass. <ul><li>General Pass: May point 3 different sets of information to up to 3 different devices.</li><li>Ultimate Pass: May point to an unlimited amount of dynamically created sets of information to an unlimited amount of devices.</li></ul></div>
<br><br><div><h3>Collective Links</h3></div>
<div>Links are way to share information when networking, whether it’s for social, business, or fun. You will be allowed to create sets of information for devices and set up links with personalized information, images and videos.</div>
<br><div>Each pass will have a specific membership which will allow the number of links per set you can have. <ul><li>General Pass: Can create up to 5 links per set.</li><li>Ultimate: Pass: Can create unlimited links per set.</li></ul></div>
<br><br><div><h3>Affiliate Share</h3></div>
<div>Qard is bigger than what meets the eye. Our web3 platform will share a web2 side. This side will be accessible for all worldwide. We are integrating an affiliate program for our NFT holders.</div>
<br><div>By simply sharing a link you will be able to share in our profits and success. The initial profit sharing model looks like this: <ul><li>General Pass: Will receive 30% of all Qard Item sales they refer to the public.</li><li>Ultimate Pass: Will receive 60% of all Qard Item sales they refer to the public.</li></ul></div>
<br><br><div>The current model we propose is to to charge an average of $50-$100 for an average Qard Item with free monthly APP use. This would mean for the General pass you’d receive $15-$30 per sale for every referral sale on average and $30-$60 per sale for every Ultimate Pass holder.</div>
<br><br><div><h3>IRL Key</h3></div>
<div>We will be working with NFT related conferences in the future to allow you access in by using our Qard NFC chip, scannable at a kiosk, treated as your entry ticket. We believe this is the path all IRL events will use as we position ourselves further into the center of this space.</div>
<br><div> Some conferences will become available for free by holding a Qard Pass as shown below: <ul><li>General Pass: Will have seldom access to IRL events to include a partial amount of general holders in a lottery like fashion. </li><li>Ultimate Pass: As we start are giving away free spots to conferences, Ultimate Pass holders will enjoy the benefits of always being first to attend if they so choose. In the event there isn’t enough spots we will hold a lottery sign-up to produce a fair playing field for random selection. </li></ul></div>
<br><br><div><h3>NFT Drops</h3></div>
<div>Qard is focused on creating partnerships and overlapping into many facets of the NFT community. As a general database and networking tool, we will be able to harness the power of indoor marketing.</div>
<br><div>We will require NFT projects who would like to work with us to give project assets in the form of NFTs to our Ultimate Pass holders. This can also include a token drop, whitelist, allowlist, and any other forms of value audited by Qard ahead of time. </div>


<br><br><div><h3>VIP Chat</h3></div>
<div>As an early investor taking a chance with us at a higher cost, we would like to provide a chat specifically for Ultimate Qard Pass holders. This will be an area where you may connect with people you never would have been able to before. </div>
<br><div> Creating a strong community, environment and listening to our early investors is what Qard is all about. </div>
<div id="partnership" class="heading">Partnership</div>
<div>Qard will be strategically partnering with a vast amount of current and upcoming NFT projects, Exchanges, Community Tools, Services and much more. We plan to become the dapp you wake up and drink your morning coffee to, scrolling through your dashboards looking at all of your favorite data.</div>
